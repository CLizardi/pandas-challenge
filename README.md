Written Report

The report shows that students in charter schools seem to have better performance in academics as far as math and reading scores are concerned in comparison to their counterparts - students in district schools. Charter schools also had higher percentages of students passing math and reading tests. Overall, passing percentages were higher in charter schools. 

If the district schools were trying to assess what they could do better they may want to implement some of the charter schools strategies to try to improve their own. What are their teaching styles, how much study or homework are students given etc. It may also be something thatâ€™s not necessarily implemented in the data such as charters school may have more money or funding, better teachers (longer teaching experience per staff in comparison, higher pay which may boost morale etc), or different student populations. With this information, they may be able to address any key differences.
